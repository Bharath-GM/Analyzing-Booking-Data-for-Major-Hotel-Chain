# Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## Overview

This project dives deep into the data of a major hotel chain to uncover insights into booking patterns, customer behavior, operational efficiency, and more. By analyzing historical booking data, this analysis aims to predict cancellation likelihoods, optimize revenue, enhance operational efficiencies, and improve overall customer satisfaction through targeted strategies and data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

- **Booking Patterns:** Analyze trends over time and the correlation between lead time and booking channels.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Examine distribution channels and guest demographics to understand their impact on bookings and revenue.
- **Revenue Optimization:** Identify trends in overall revenue and devise optimal pricing strategies for different customer segments and distribution channels.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Explore guest distribution by country and assess the correlation between country of origin and booking outcomes.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Analyze average length of stay and check-out patterns to inform staffing and resource allocation.
- **Impact of Deposit Types:** Investigate how deposit requirements affect cancellation likelihoods and revenue.
- **Analysis of Corporate Bookings:** Compare corporate bookings' ADR and proportion to other customer types.

## Dataset

The dataset includes comprehensive booking details, guest demographics, financial metrics, and more, facilitating an in-depth analysis of the hotel chain's operations and customer interactions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Analysis Tool:** Jupyter Notebook
